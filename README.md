For more information on why Axon use UTC time [check out their website](https://help.axon.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002746247-Axon-Camera-Video-Watermark-Timestamp) and use this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UTC_time_offsets) to find what your UTC offset would be if you want to use one.
